"""
This module contains the ``mpl_style`` function which applies the SNEEstylepython ``matplotlib`` theme

Some of the tick properties cannot be set using ``plt.style.use``,
so we have to set them in code.

We want the user to be able to apply the full style, including styling the
minor ticks, using only a _single_ function call. To make this possible we need
to monkey patch as we first need to apply the style using ``plt.style.use``,
then create a figure (using either ``plt.figure`` or ``plt.Figure`` or
``plt.subplots``), and _then_ get from this figure the axes to style the ticks.
